# Introduction
This is a simple mdns service discovery inspired by from https://github.com/sudomesh/mdnssd-min

It has been updated to compile under Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD and SOlaris and split into a integrable part and a test program so that it can be included into various projects.

Please see [here](https://github.com/philippe44/cross-compiling/blob/master/README.md#organizing-submodules--packages) to understand proxy proxy repositories and to know how to rebuild my apps in general
